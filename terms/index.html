Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else herein to the contrary, Gitploy will not be liable to you or any third party acting on your behalf in any way with respect to a trial program or your provision of an individual’s personal information to Gitploy or through the Service. You further agree that the foregoing limitations will apply with respect to third party liability of any kind.</p><p>The foregoing limitations will also apply with respect to any damages incurred by reason of any content or services provided on any third party sites or otherwise provided by any third parties other than Gitploy and received by you through or advertised on the Service or received by you on any third party sites.

Gitploy reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Gitploy and you agree to cooperate with Gitploy’ defense of these Claims. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of Gitploy. Gitploy will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such Claims upon becoming aware of it.</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p><p>If there is any dispute between you and Gitploy about or involving the Terms or the Service, you hereby agree that the dispute will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p><p>Except for any claim involving the ownership of intellectual property, all disputes arising out of or in connection with the Terms will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre. The appointing authority will be the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre. The case will be adjudicated by a single arbitrator and will be administered by the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre in accordance with its rules. The place of arbitration will be Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The language of the arbitration will be English.</p><p>If any portion of the Terms is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, the Terms as a whole will not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of the Terms that is unlawful, void or unenforceable will be stricken from the Terms.</p><p>You agree that the Terms are specifically enforceable by Gitploy through injunctive relief and other equitable remedies without proof of monetary damages.</p><p>You agree that if Gitploy does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Gitploy has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Gitploy’ rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Gitploy.</p><p>The Terms are the entire agreement between us related to the subject matter in the Terms. The Terms replace and supersede any other prior or contemporaneous agreement, representation or discussion, oral or written, and may not be changed except in writing signed by us, regardless of whether or not the parties act under an unsigned “electronic” agreement or rely on such an unsigned agreement.</p><p><strong>Contacting Gitploy</strong>
