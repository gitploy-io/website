# Gitploy

## What is Gitploy?

GitHub provides the [deployment API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/deployments#deployments) to deploy a specific ref(branch, SHA, tag). It offers strong features to make your team (or organization) can deploy fast and safely. But it takes a lot of resources to build the deployment system around GitHub deployment API. 

Gitploy makes your team or organization build the deployment system around GitHub in minutes. Now, do not waste time building the deployment system.
