# Terms Of Service

**Updated October 5, 2021**

These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) describe the rights and responsibilities that apply to your use of Gitploy (the “Service”), owned and operated by Gitploy Inc. (“Gitploy”, “we”, “our” or “us”).

Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service. If you don’t agree to the Terms, as well as our Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”), you may not use the Service. If you are entering into the Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to the Terms. If you do not have such authority, you must not accept the Terms or use the Service on behalf of such entity. The Service is only available to you if you have entered the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence and are fully able and competent to enter into, abide by and comply with the Terms.

**Your Account**

If you create an account on the Service (your “Account”), you are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and its Content (as defined below), and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your Account and any other actions taken on the Service. You must not describe or assign Content to your Account in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others, and Gitploy may remove any Content, description, or keyword that it considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to cause Gitploy liability. You must immediately notify Gitploy of any unauthorized uses of your Account or any other breaches of security. Gitploy will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

**Fees and Renewals**

There will be no refunds or credits for cancellation of use of the Service by you or Gitploy.

By purchasing purchasing a fee-based Service you agree that third party payment gateways, such as Stripe and Paypal, may store your payment information. You expressly agree that we are authorized to charge you (i) a fee for any applicable Service which you have purchased, billed immediately, (ii) any additional fees for the Service you may purchase, (iii) any charges for use of the Service in excess of the usage or other limits placed on your use of the Service (and you hereby consent to such charges and agree we are not required to notify you of any such charge in advance) and (iv) any applicable taxes in connection with your use of the Service to the credit or charge card you provide and to reimburse us for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. If the payment information you provide expires and you do not provide new payment information or cancel your Account, you authorize us to continue billing you and you agree to remain responsible for any uncollected fees.

You take full responsibility for all taxes and fees of any nature associated with the Service, including any sales tax related to any purchase or sale of services or goods under the Terms. When purchasing or selling services or goods under the Terms, it is your responsibility to determine whether or not sales taxes apply to a transaction and to collect, report and remit the correct amounts to the appropriate authority.

**Your Responsibilities**

If you operate an Account, post material to the Service, post Content on the Service, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Service (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text or graphics. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:

The downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;

If your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;

You have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;

The Content does not contain or install any viruses or other harmful or destructive content;

The Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);

The Content is not obscene, libelous or defamatory, hateful or racially or ethnically objectionable, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;

Your Account is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, other blogs and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;

Your Account is not named in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are another person or company. For example, your Account’s URL or name is not the name of a person other than yourself or company other than your own;

And you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by Gitploy or otherwise. By uploading Content or otherwise providing Content to Gitploy, you grant Gitploy the right to use (including the right to host, index, cache and format) and display your Content in connection with providing the Service as well as otherwise on our marketing communications with you and other users and prospective users of the Service, including without limitation on our emails, marketing channels and other promotional materials (subject to the requirements set out in the Privacy Policy). To the extent we use your Content in our marketing communications, unless you expressly permit us to do otherwise, we will always cite you as the owner of such Content. This paragraph will survive the termination or expiry of the Terms.

Gitploy reserves the right to refuse or remove any Content or terminate or deny access to your Account or use of the Service for any reason whatsoever.

All Content uploaded is copyright © their respective owners.

If you delete Content, Gitploy will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Service, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.

Gitploy does not have any control over such websites and webpages, and is not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to an external website or webpage, Gitploy does not represent or imply that it endorses such website or webpage.

Gitploy has no liability to you for suspending the Service under this provision.

This section does not apply to Content; however you agree that any ideas, suggestions, concepts, processes or techniques which you provide to Gitploy related to the Service or Gitploy or its business (“Feedback”) are and will be exclusive property of Gitploy without any compensation or other consideration payable to you and you do so of your own free will and volition. Gitploy may or may not, in its sole discretion, use or incorporate the Feedback in whatever form or derivative Gitploy may decide into the Service or its business or other products.

Gitploy’ total aggregate liability from any and all claims under the Terms is limited to the total amounts you paid to Gitploy in the one (1) year immediately preceding the occurrence of loss or damage. To the extent any province, state or jurisdiction does not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, Gitploy’ liability in such province, state or jurisdiction will be limited to the furthest extent permitted by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else herein to the contrary, Gitploy will not be liable to you or any third party acting on your behalf in any way with respect to a trial program or your provision of an individual’s personal information to Gitploy or through the Service. You further agree that the foregoing limitations will apply with respect to third party liability of any kind.

The foregoing limitations will also apply with respect to any damages incurred by reason of any content or services provided on any third party sites or otherwise provided by any third parties other than Gitploy and received by you through or advertised on the Service or received by you on any third party sites. You also agree that Gitploy will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as the result of any interactions or dealings with advertisers or as the result of the presence of such advertisers on the Service.

With respect to any dispute arising out of or related to the Service and/or the Terms: (i) you hereby expressly give up your right to have a trial by jury; and (ii) you hereby expressly give up your right to participate as a member of a class of claimants, in any lawsuit including but not limited to class action lawsuits involving any such dispute.

You agree that you will not bring a claim under or related to the Terms more than one (1) year from when your claim first arose.

You represent and warrant that (i) your use of the Service will be in strict accordance with the Terms, the Privacy Policy, and all applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations in your country, state, city, or other governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the Canada or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of the Service will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.

**Indemnification**

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Gitploy, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, co-branders, all third-party advertisers, technology providers, service providers or other partners, and each of their respective officers, directors, agents, shareholders, employees and representatives (together, the “Indemnified Parties”), from and against any third party claim, demand, loss, damage, cost, or liability (including, reasonable attorneys’ fees) (collectively and individually, “Claims”) incurred by or made against the Indemnified Parties in connection with any Claims arising out of or relating to the Terms, the Service, including but without limitation in relation to: (a) your use, non-use or misuse of, or connection to the Service and any Content; (b) your violation or alleged violation of the Terms; and (c) your violation of any rights, including intellectual property rights, of a third party and otherwise as set out herein. Gitploy reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify Gitploy and you agree to cooperate with Gitploy’ defense of these Claims. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of Gitploy. Gitploy will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such Claims upon becoming aware of it.

**Miscellaneous**

If there is any dispute between you and Gitploy about or involving the Terms or the Service, you hereby agree that the dispute will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Except for any claim involving the ownership of intellectual property, all disputes arising out of or in connection with the Terms will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre. The appointing authority will be the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre. The case will be adjudicated by a single arbitrator and will be administered by the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre in accordance with its rules. The place of arbitration will be Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The language of the arbitration will be English.

If any portion of the Terms is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, the Terms as a whole will not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of the Terms that is unlawful, void or unenforceable will be stricken from the Terms.

You agree that the Terms are specifically enforceable by Gitploy through injunctive relief and other equitable remedies without proof of monetary damages.

You agree that if Gitploy does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Gitploy has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Gitploy’ rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Gitploy.

The Terms are the entire agreement between us related to the subject matter in the Terms. The Terms replace and supersede any other prior or contemporaneous agreement, representation or discussion, oral or written, and may not be changed except in writing signed by us, regardless of whether or not the parties act under an unsigned “electronic” agreement or rely on such an unsigned agreement.
